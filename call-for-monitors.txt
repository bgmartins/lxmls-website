taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, and focused on Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The school hosts around 200 students selected from
more than 500 applicants from around the world and enjoys top
lecturers in machine learning from academia and industry.

The 12th edition will take place from July 24th to the 29th, 2022.

We are looking for candidates to take following responsibilities

- Master the LxMLS lab guide and code. See last year's guide as

- Tutor students during the labs sessions, explaining exercises and 
  addressing the student's doubts.

- Assist in the organization of the school, including Q&A sessions

The ideal profile for this role is former LxMLS alumni, that would 
like to repeat the experience and want to keep learning ML and NLP. If

teach the guide, this can also be a good role for you. We organize the 
team with Git/GitHub so experience with both is a plus.

so there is available free time during the school.
